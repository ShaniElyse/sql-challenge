# sql-challenge
  -	This project consisted of being a data engineer at a fictional company doing a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980’s and 1990’s. All that remained of the employee database from that period were 6 CSV files; I had to design the tables to hold the data from CSV files, import the CSV files into an SQL database, and then perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
